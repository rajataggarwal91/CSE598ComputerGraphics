Questions : 
What are the situations when display() function runs, I can see that it executes continuously in loop.
To extend the first question, why does opengl continuously call display() when it is a static state machine?
I am unable to call function loadPNG from display(), dont know why exactly that is. Says loadPNG : redefinition different data types. SO created a new function bgimage()
If I remove the only call to loadPNG available it throws memory violation exception. Not sure why?
why is the image made inverted?
